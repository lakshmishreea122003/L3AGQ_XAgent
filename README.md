# L3AGQ_XAgent

## Objective
This goal of this project is to replace the existing Langchain REACT Agent with XAgent in the L3AGI project. 

## Approach
### Dependencies
- Removed all the dependencies related to Langchain REACT Agent in L3AGI PROJECT.
- Replaced them with XAgent framework related dependencies.

### Target Files
- test.py, conversational.py, and dialogue_agent_with_tools.py are the target files I considered to be modified.
- These are the key areas in the L3AGI framework where the Langchain REACT Agent was implemented.
