# L3AGQ_XAgent

## Objective
The goal of this project is to replace the existing LangChain REACT Agent with XAgent in the L3AGI project, ensuring that XAgent works seamlessly with all existing components, just as the LangChain REACT Agent did.

## Approach
### Dependencies
- Removed all the dependencies related to Langchain REACT Agent in L3AGI PROJECT. Like from langchain.agents import create_react_agent.
- Replaced them with XAgent framework related dependencies.

### Target Files
- test.py, conversational.py, and dialogue_agent_with_tools.py are the target files I considered to be modified.
- These are the key areas in the L3AGI framework where the Langchain REACT Agent was implemented.

### Key Modifications
- XAgent Initialization: The new XAgent was initialised as "agent=XAgent(xagent_config)" instead of "agent=create_react_agent(llm, tools, prompt=agentPrompt)".
- Replaced Langchain’s initialize_agent and AgentType.CHAT_CONVERSATIONAL_REACT_DESCRIPTION to XAgent initialization.
- Updated the configurations and dependencies for XAgent.

### Changes in conversational.py
- Included dependencies for XAgent
  ```
  from xagent import XAgent
  from xagent.config import XAgentConfig
  ```
- Initialized XAgent with XAgentConfig for configurations.
  ```
  xagent_config = XAgentConfig(
                llm=llm,
                tools=tools,
                memory=memory,
                system_message=system_message,
                verbose=True,
                output_parser=ConvoOutputParser(),
            )
  agent = XAgent(xagent_config)
  agent_executor = agent.get_executor()
  ```
- Replaced Langchain’s AgentExecutor with XAgent’s direct execution flow using XAgent.run().

### Changes in dialogue_agent_with_tools.py
- The imports added is ``` from xagent import XAgent ```.
- Initialized XAgent
  ```
  agent = XAgent(
                tools=tools,
                llm=llm,
                agent_kwargs={
                    "system_message": system_message,
                    "output_parser": ConvoOutputParser(),
                },
            )
  ```

### Changes in test.py
- Implemented the agent_factory() method for XAgent.
  ```
  def agent_factory():
    config = XAgentConfig(
        llm=ChatOpenAI(temperature=0, model_name="gpt-3.5-turbo"),
        tools=get_tools(["SerpGoogleSearch"]),
        verbose=True
    )
    return XAgent(config)
  ```

  ### Challenges
  - Compatibility: Updating the code to align with XAgent requirements considering XAgent requires different initialization parameters and configurations.
  -  Dependencies: New dependencies had to be installed for XAgent, which I was unaware of. Replacing the Langchain REACT Agent dependencies with XAgent dependencies was challenging to figure out.
  -  Testing: Ensuring XAgent worked seamlessly with all existing components and learning to test the project using pytest was another challenging factor for me.

### Observations
- Transition from Langchain React Agent to XAgent was a straightforward approach with minimal changes required to be done in the code base.
- XAgent is easy to use and efficient considering the fact that it is more modular and flexible compaired to Langchain REACT Agent.

### Conclusion
Replacement of Langchain REACT Agent with XAgent into the L3AGI framework was successful. This process involved removing the Langchain REACT Agent dependencies and its initialization. Then replacing it with XAgent required dependencies, initialization of XAgent, seamless component integration and testing.
